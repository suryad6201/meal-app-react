## Knowledge used:
In this project I have explored many important concepts in React such as
- React Fundamentals

- useReducer, useContext, useRefs
- React Portals
- Rendering Lists 
- Form Validation
- Modules
- Publisher-subscriber pattern

[This React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course from Udemy helped me a lot to learn React concepts and to complete this project.

Note: Run "npm install" in the terminal to install the dependencies in your computer.
